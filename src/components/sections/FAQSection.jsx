      question: "How does the APK security analysis work?",
      answer:
        "Our advanced AI system performs multiple security checks including code integrity analysis, digital signature verification, permission analysis, malware signature detection, and behavioral pattern analysis. The process uses machine learning models trained on millions of applications to identify potential threats.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is my APK file stored on your servers?",
      answer:
        "No, absolutely not. We prioritize your privacy and security. All analysis is performed in real-time and no file data is stored on our servers. Your APK files are processed temporarily and immediately discarded after analysis completion.",
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the threat detection?",
      answer:
        "Our system maintains a 99.7% accuracy rate based on extensive testing with known malicious and legitimate banking applications. However, no system is 100% perfect, so we recommend always downloading apps from official sources like Google Play Store or Apple App Store.",
    },
    {
      question: "What types of threats can be detected?",
      answer:
        "We detect various threats including malware signatures, trojans, suspicious permission requests, code obfuscation, unauthorized network connections, data harvesting attempts, and behavioral anomalies commonly found in fake banking applications.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the analysis take?",
      answer:
        "Most analyses complete within 15-30 seconds, depending on the APK file size and complexity. Our real-time processing ensures you get immediate results without long waiting periods.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this for non-banking applications?",
      answer:
        "While our system is specifically optimized for banking and financial applications, it can provide valuable security insights for other types of APK files as well. However, the accuracy and recommendations are tailored for financial apps.",
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do if an app is marked as suspicious?",
      answer:
        "If an application is marked as suspicious or dangerous, we strongly recommend not installing it. Instead, download the official banking app directly from your bank's website or verified app stores. Contact your bank if you're unsure about an application's legitimacy.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a file size limit?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we currently support APK files up to 100MB in size. This covers the vast majority of banking applications. Larger files may require special handling or extended processing time.",
    },
